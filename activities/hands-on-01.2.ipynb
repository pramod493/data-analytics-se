    "## The model calibration problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The model calibration problem is the inverse of the uncertainty propagation problem.\n",
    "That is why such problems are also called **inverse problems**.\n",
    "It goes as follows. \n",
    "One observes a quantity that is predicted by the model and they want to go back and characterize how this observation changes the state of knowledge about the parameters of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Driving a trailer on a rough road\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the example of the previous handout: We have a trailer of mass $m$ moving on a rough road with speed $v$.\n",
    "The suspension spring constant is $k$.\n",
    "We are intersted in the vibration amplitude $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Trailer](trailer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we put sensors on the suspension of the trailer to measure the amplitude of oscillation.\n",
    "The amplitude that the sensors measure does not match exactly the prediction of the model.\n",
    "Why is that?\n",
    "First, there is observation noise.\n",
    "Second, our model has a systematic error (e.g., we have completely ignored dumping effects).\n",
    "So, *the measurement is not the same as the model prediction*.\n",
    "This means that we need to add one more node to the graphical representation of the model.\n",
    "The new node, let's call it $X_m$ is the result of the measurement."
